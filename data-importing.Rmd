### From databases

Instructions for database access

(1) Install DBeaver (unless you already have desktop database client software you prefer): Here is a link to download for both Windows and Mac OS X. We will be using the community edition 7.0.0. for accessing PostgreSQL databases.

The Community Edition is free. Note that DBeaver uses and requires Java. If you install it via the Windows or MacOS installer then you donâ€™t need to install Java separately.


(2) Download and install Cisco Mobility VPN client: See instructions here.

After launch, select the "UVA Anywhere" network.

You need to use the VPN if and only if you are access the database from off-Grounds. When you are on-Grounds, skip this step.

(3) Log into Postgres DB: 

    Host: va-energy2.postgres.database.azure.com
    Username: [your UVA id]@va-energy2
    Password:  [Contact Chloe Fauvel Chloe to get your individual password]
    Port: 5432
    Initial database: postgres

Please don't share your individual credentials.
