# R Markdown 

Markdown is a markup language: a set of formatting instructions for rendering documents. R Markdown is an extension of Markdown that allows for embedding chunks of R code into a Markdown document. In this course, we will write our work in R Markdown within the R Studio environment, then use the `knitr` package to generate HTML and PDF output files.

For a nice introduction to Markdown and R Markdown, watch the short YouTube video [Reproducible Reports with R Markdown (STAT 545 Episode 3-A)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzDSkBgt9xQ) from the University of British Columbia.

As you proceed in creating your documents, you will probably want to access additional resources:
